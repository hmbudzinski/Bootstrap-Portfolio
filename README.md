# Portfolio

## What: 
    We took the backbone of html from our first homework portfolio and added bootstrap elements to make the site more compatible and responsive. 

## Why:
    Using bootstrap helps to streamline the process of creating the basic format of a website. It also provides a lot of basic css within the html so you dont need to create as much css in a separate file. 

## How:
    Creating this site was slightly easier than the first week's homework, although it did still have its issues that took longer to solve since bootstrap is new to me. I started off with creating all of the HTML for the each page, including using bootstrap for the header and content, I then created the CSS for the entire site and lastly went back through and converted what I could to bootstrap elements.  

## Features:
    My page features links to my other pages, a collapsable navbar, responsive images and a responsive layout.

## Difficulties:
    I had less difficulites creating this page than I did the first portfolio page, but the issues that I did have were harder to solve since I am so new to bootstrap. Getting my portfolio page to align correctly and my navbar to operate correctly where very difficult and I wouldn't have been able to complete it without help.
